# Simple-Introduction-To-Classification-In-Machine-Learning
A simple code for beginners to use machine learning and classify data

# Project Aim
Training a model to separate data based on the data's features can be intimidating to people starting out on machine learning. Therefore, this project aims to provide a simple introduction to classification in machine learning so that beginners can learn how to use machine learning to classify data.

# Methodology
1. Our data will the Breast Cancer dataset from Sklearn's datasets where X contains features for each instances and y is their class
2. We will then split our data into 80% training data and 20% testing data to train and test our model respectively
3. We will be using a simple Logistic Regression Model for this task

# Conclusion
The code in the notebook provides a basic flow from data collection to data classification and through the documentation, although it may seem simple, I hope it will help people that are new to machine learning to understand the process and feel more confident to embark on more advanced projects and topics.
