# Simple-Introduction-To-Classification-In-Machine-Learning
A simple code for beginners to use machine learning and classify data

# Project Aim
Training a model to classify data based on the data's features can be intimidating to people starting out on machine learning. Therefore, this project aims to provide a simple introduction to classification in machine learning so that beginners can learn how to use machine learning to classify data.

# Methodology
1. Our data will be the Breast Cancer dataset from Sklearn's datasets where X contains features for each instances and y is their class
2. We will then split our data into 80% training data and 20% testing data to train and test our model respectively
3. We will be using a simple Logistic Regression Model for this task

# Conclusion
The model we have created is able to classify about 93.9% of the test data correctly which is pretty good. I hope that through this simple example, it is able to help people that are new to machine learning to understand the process from data collection to training and classification, and feel more confident when embarking onto more advanced projects and topics in machine learning. All the best!
